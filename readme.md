### *When Artificial Intelligence meets Business Intelligence*

## Description

   The Corporate Bullshit Generator is a high-performance random text generator
   that is focused on corporate language. It is able to produce, per second,
   1000 full A4 pages of inspired and inspirational sentences like "Our turn-key branding strategy
   drives corporate, scalable, wide-ranging and profit-oriented idiosyncratic incentives."

## Features

   * 1700+ smart-sounding nouns, adjectives, adverbs, constructs
   * context-sensitive
   * includes a random boss title generator (e.g.: General President of Facilities
       Management, Executive Co-Head of Business Planning)

The easiest way to run the Generator yourself is via [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/crates/cbsg).
The following Alire commands will lead you to the realm of automated business intelligence:

```
alr get cbsg
cd cbsg*
alr run
```

Alternatively, you can build the executables of the generator with an Ada compiler you get yourself.
On Debian or Ubuntu, get GNAT (a free Ada compiler) the standard way for getting software: apt install gnat
On other Linux branches you may have an equivalent command like yum.
On Windows or MacOS, you can get GNAT for free [here](https://www.adacore.com/download).
Then, run "gprbuild -p -P delirium" (GNAT) or similar process.
The executable is "produce_corporate_bullshit" or "produce_corporate_bullshit.exe" (Windows)
There are other Ada compilers (ObjectAda, Janus, etc.) that are not free but for which the CBSG will work as well.
